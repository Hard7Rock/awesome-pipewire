# Contributing

Do you want to contribute? We'd love that.

Our goal is to have mostly projects that are stable and useful to many users.

## How?

The easiest way is to go to https://github.com/Hard7Rock/awesome-pipewire/blob/master/README.md and click on the "pen" icon in the upper right corner. Make the changes to the file and follow the instructions to create a pull request.

If you want to add an entry to the `README.md` please consider this:

- is the entry valuable to people trying to get things done in PipeWire?
- if you want to add something, please use the template `[YYY](https://github.com/XXX/YYY) â€” DESCRIPTION`
- please pay attention to the alphabetical ordering.


## Removing projects

We don't remove projects unless they are outright broken or pronounced deprecated by another project or by its author.
